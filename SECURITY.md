## Supply Chain Security

### Signed Releases

All release artifacts are signed using [Cosign](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign) with keyless signing (Sigstore). To verify a release:

```bash
# Download the checksum file and its signature for the desired release version
curl -LO https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd/releases/download/{VERSION}/kubefwd_checksums.txt
curl -LO https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd/releases/download/{VERSION}/kubefwd_checksums.txt.sigstore.json

# Verify the signature
cosign verify-blob \
  --bundle kubefwd_checksums.txt.sigstore.json \
  --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/txn2/kubefwd" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
  kubefwd_checksums.txt
```

### SLSA Provenance

Releases include [SLSA Level 3](https://slsa.dev) provenance attestations generated by the official SLSA GitHub generator. This provides a verifiable record that artifacts were built from this repository using the documented build process.

### Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

Each release archive includes an SBOM generated by [Syft](https://github.com/anchore/syft) in SPDX format. SBOMs list all dependencies, enabling vulnerability scanning and license compliance verification.
