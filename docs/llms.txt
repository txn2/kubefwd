# kubefwd

> Kubernetes bulk port forwarding for local development. Forward services from any namespace to localhost with automatic /etc/hosts entries and unique IPs per service.

kubefwd enables developers to work locally while accessing services running in Kubernetes. Each service gets its own unique loopback IP (127.x.x.x), eliminating port conflicts. Access cluster services by name—exactly as in-cluster.
